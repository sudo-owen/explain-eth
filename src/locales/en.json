      "This is a series of articles that tries to explain the basics of blockchain in a simplified way. I do my best to avoid heavy math or programming jargon, but there <i>will</i> be some new words and ideas. I try to use real-world examples when possible to help bridge the gap.",

      "Let's get started.",
      "What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a <0>blockchain network</0> for <1>sending money</1> and <2>running apps</2>.",
      "What does that mean?"
    ],
    "network": [
      "In general, a <0>network</0> is a group of connected things, like a social network. As long as something is in the network, you can reach it. Just like how on the Facebook network, you can send a message to anyone as long as they have an account.",
      "(I know we didn't define <0>blockchain</0> yet, don't worry, we'll get to it.)"
    ],
    "account": [
      "Like a social media network, you'll need an <0>account</0> to get started using Ethereum. An account will let you receive <1>money</1>. You can receive many types of digital assets with your account.",
      "Let's give you a test account to get started:",
      "Every account has a unique ID, called an <0>address</0>. Your simulated address is <1>0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2</1>. Just like how an email address lets you receive emails on the internet, your Ethereum address lets you receive ETH on the Ethereum network."
    ],
    "eth": [
      "What is ETH? ETH is the native currency of the Ethereum network. Like Bitcoin, it's another digital currency that you can trade or transfer.",
      "Here, let's give you 1 (simulated) ETH to get started below."
    ],
    "sending": [
      "Now that you have some ETH, you can send it around to other people.",
      "Let's give you some simulated friends to send money to.",
      "Meet Alice, Bob, and Carol.",
      "Now try sending them some ETH!"
    ],
    "confirmation": [
      "So far you have sent {totalAmountSent} ETH. Nice! After sending ETH, we get the pop-up below. What does it mean?",
      "Once it turns green, your send transaction has been <0>confirmed</0>. This lets you know that it was successful, i.e. that it went through."
    ],
    "timing": [
      "Sending money on Ethereum isn't instant. It's faster than a bank transfer (no need to wait 1-2 business days), but it's also a little slower than Venmo or Zelle.",
      "Specifically, on Ethereum, it takes <0>up to 12 seconds</0> to complete a transaction.",
      "Does this mean we can only take one action on Ethereum every 12 seconds? If so, that would be inconvenient.",
      "What if we have to send money to multiple people? Do we need to send first to Alice, wait 12 seconds, then send to Bob, wait, and so on?",
      "Thankfully, not quite.",
      "On Ethereum, we can send out multiple transactions to different accounts. Then, in around 12 seconds, they'll all happen one after another in quick succession.",
      "How does that work? Here's an example."
    ],
    "train": [
      "Imagine that we're at a train station, and we want to deliver some packages to the next stop. If we have multiple packages to deliver, we can still put them all on the same train, and they'll all get delivered together at the next stop.",
      "Of course, instead of packages we're sending ETH. And instead of waiting for the next train, we're waiting at most 12 seconds for our transactions to go through.",
      "But why does it take 12 seconds at all? Why isn't it instant?"
    ],
    "blocks": [
      "It's because of something called <0>block time</0>. On Ethereum, it takes about 12 seconds for the network to create a <1>block</1>. <2>On average, it's probably closer to 6 seconds, so the animations you see are actually running at 2x speed. But don't worry about this too much.</2> This \"block\" is what makes up the word \"blockchain.\"",
      "But what <i>is</i> a block?",
      "Think of a block like a train in the animation above. The train arrives on schedule, picks up everyone's transactions, then leaves for its destination. <0>Here is an actual real-time visualization for the Ethereum network if you are curious.</0>",
      "Let's say that you have to pay Alice, Bob, <em>and</em> Carol. All of them. Maybe they each took you out to dinner last week.",
      "Try sending each of them ETH. (The send button will automatically load the next recipient.)",
      "When we send out all these different transactions, they get collected into a <0>block</0>. So a block is a list of all the transactions that have happened. And a new block gets published around every 12 seconds.",
      "Once we have more than one block, we have a <0>blockchain</0>. As the name suggests, it's a chain of blocks, or an ordered list of transactions."
    ],
    "apps": [
      "But what other types of transactions are there? So far we've only seen sending and receiving ETH.",
      "In addition to sending ETH around, we can also interact with <0>apps</0> on the Ethereum network. These interactions are also transactions!",
      "What does that mean? What does an app look like?",
      "Let's explore the basics of <0>apps</0>..."

      "What are tokens?",

              Hi, this is an interactive essay that tries to explain the very basics of <strong>Ethereum</strong>, <strong>blockchains</strong>, and <strong>rollups</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If you have no idea what any of those words mean, or you just want to play around with some interactive animations, then keep reading.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Many ideas presented here will be simplified, so please keep in mind that the actual concepts <em>will</em> be more detailed. (For all the experts in the room, please don't complain about all the ways that things will be wrong and just enjoy the fun animations.)

              Let's get started. What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a <strong>blockchain network for sending money and running apps</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What does that mean?
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Well, a <strong>network</strong> is a group of connected things, like a social network. As long as someone is in the network, you can reach them. Just like how on the Facebook network, you can send a message to anyone as long as they have an account.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              (I know we didn't define <strong>blockchain</strong> yet, don't worry, we'll get to it.)

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Like a social media network, we'll need an account to get started. And we'll also need some <strong>money</strong>. On Ethereum, the money that we can send around is called ETH. Here, let's give you 1 ETH to get started:

            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Ah, you also need some friends to send money to. Meet Alice, Bob, and Carol.

              Okay, a lot of things just happened. We got a pop-up, we got a countdown, we got this other panel, what does all of this mean?
